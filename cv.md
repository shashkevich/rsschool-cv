## About me

I studied at the Faculty of Economics and graduated from the university in 2010. Since then, I have worked in companies such as Sportmaster, Tervolina, and later became an entrepreneur, which I have been for 8 years. I have a stable income, but my craving for new knowledge, technology and the desire to develop led me to study programming. I already have practice in creating a website in html/css for my company - a small print studio. The next goal is to learn the JavaScript language and become an Frontend Developer. I believe that my current skills and life experience will enable me to succeed.

## Skills

* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* JavaScript (basic)
* Git (basic)
* VS Code
* Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator

## Code example

#### Are You Playing Banjo?

Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

```
function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  if (name[0] == 'r' || name[0] == 'R') {
    return name + " plays banjo"; 
  } else {
    return name + " does not play banjo";
  };  
}
```

## Experience

* Small own business since 2015 - print studuo. I developed website for it using HTML/CSS: https://n1foto.com/ .

## Education
