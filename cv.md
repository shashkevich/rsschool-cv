## About me

I studied

I studied at the Faculty of Economics and graduated from the university in 2010. Since then, I have worked in companies such as Sportmaster, Tervolina, and later became an entrepreneur, which I have been for 8 years. I have a stable income, but my craving for new knowledge, technology and the desire to develop led me to study programming. I already have experience in creating a website in html/css for my company - a small print studio. The next goal is to learn the JavaScript language and become an experienced Frontend developer. I believe that my current skills and life experience will enable me to succeed.
